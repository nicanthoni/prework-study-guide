        <h2>Javascript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means 'myVariable' is not the same as 'myvariable'. </li>
          <li>// This is a comment (in Javascript & CSS). This can be placed on its own line, or right after some code.</li>
          <li>A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with <strong>/*</strong> to begin the comment, and <strong>*/</strong> to end the comment.</li>
          <li>Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types: <em>Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol,</em> & <em>Object.</em></li>
          <li>For types, Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === "object").</li>
          <li>An <strong>operator</strong> (+, -, *, /, and %) is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers.</li>
          <li>Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a + operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string</li>
          <li>console.log('no' + 'space'); // Prints 'nospace'</li>
          <li>console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5. The ' . ' is another operator! We call it the dot operator. In the example here, the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the instance of the string, 'Hello'. The program prints 5 to the console, because Hello has five characters in it.</li>
          <li> <strong>Methods</strong> are actions we can perform. Data types have access to specific methods that allow us to handle instances of that data type. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.</li>
          <li>We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with: <em>a period</em>(the dot operator),<em>the name of the method, opening and closing parenthesis. </em>E.g. <strong>'example string'.methodName()</strong>. When we use console.log() we’re calling the .log() method on the console object.</li>
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. </li>
          <li><strong>Math.ceil()</strong> returns the smallest integer (whole number) greater than or equal to 'x'.</li>
          <li><strong>Math.random()</strong> generates a random number between 0 and 1. <strong>Math.floor()</strong> rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.</li>
         <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number">Number.isInteger()</a> determines whether the passed value is an integer.</li>
         <li>We can insert, or <em>interpolate</em>, variables into strings using <em>template literals</em>.</li> 
         <li>A <strong>template literal</strong> is wrapped by backticks ` (this key is usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key). Inside the template literal, you’ll see a placeholder, ${myVar}. The value of myVar is inserted into the template literal. When we interpolate `I own a pet ${myPet}.`, the output we print is the string: 'I own a pet cat.'</li>
         <li><strong>console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}`)</strong> = <em>My name is Nic. My favorite city is London.</em></li>
         <li><strong>typeof operator:</strong> checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.</li>
         <li><strong>let myName = 'Nic'.toLowerCase()</strong> creates a myName string variable that will always display in lowercase: "nic"</li>
         <li>A <strong>conditional statement</strong> checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s). Think <em>if, else if</em>, and <em>else</em> statements</li>
         <li>When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called <em>comparison operators</em>.</li>
         <li>Think of comparison statements as questions. When the answer is “yes”, the statement evaluates to true, and when the answer is “no”, the statement evaluates to false. </li>
         <li>We can use a <strong>ternary operator</strong> to simplify an <em>if...else</em> statement. Example: <strong>isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');</strong></li>
         <li>The  <strong>else if statement</strong> allows for more than two possible outcomes. if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.</li>
         <li>A <strong>switch statement</strong> provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write, versus needing to write 100 else if statements to check multiple values.</li>
         <li> - The <em>switch keyword</em> initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the value that each case will compare.</li>
         <li> - Inside the block, { ... }, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first case is 'tomato'. If the value of groceryItem equalled 'tomato', that case‘s console.log() would run.</li>
         <li> - The <em>break keyword</em> tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block.</li>
         <li> - At the end of each switch statement, there is a <em>default statement</em>. If none of the cases are true, then the code in the default statement will run.</li>
         <li>Since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
         <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>git pull
