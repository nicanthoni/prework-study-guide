          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means 'myVariable' is not the same as 'myvariable'</li>
          <li>// This is a comment (in Javascript & CSS)</li>
          <li>For types, Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === "object").</li>
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. </li>
          <li>Since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
